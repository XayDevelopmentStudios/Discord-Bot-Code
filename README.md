# Discord-Bot-Code

Hey party people. Want to make a Discord bot, but don't know how? Remix mine!
My bot is going to be taken down by myself, I don't have time to contiue developing it as I know run my own discord server. 
Onto the point, I'd perfer if you all made an attempt to change the code for your own bot, but this is a jumping off point. 

The token and info inside of the settings.json file is not valid anymore.
